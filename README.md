MonoGame-WinForms
=================

This project is mainly template code for embedding MonoGame utilities and games into WinForms controls.

The code is originally derived from the MSDN tutorial [WinForms Series 1: Graphics Device][1].

This code also supports a series of tutorials on embedding MonoGame in WinForms:
* [Bringing your XNA WinForms Controls to MonoGame + OpenGL][2]
* [Embedding Your MonoGame Game in a WinForms Control][3]
* [MonoGame + WinForms: Where’s My Keyboard?][4]

The intent is for this repository to unify the tutorials into a single solution that can be used as a template for actual projects.
